Plastic Origins is a project from the not-for-profit Surfrider Foundation Europe (www.surfrider.eu). We aim to map river plastic pollution for the following reasons:

1. Ocean plastic pollution mainly comes from terrestrial sources. Rivers are pathways for litter entering the ocean. For instance, a bottle lost in Paris city might end-up in the Seine River and reach the sea.
2. Investigating river plastic pollution helps to localize plastic inputs and monitor trends, improvements and measures efficiency.
3. There is currently no obligation for European countries to monitor river plastic pollution. The European water framework directive does not include plastic pollution as an indicator for good environmental status.


## All you need to know to get involved

Developments and improvements of Surfrider Plastic Origins tech tools are led by a bunch of amazing volunteers. Surfrider Europe in its own does not have within the organisation competencies to make all those developments. We rely on YOU for making this project a success.
